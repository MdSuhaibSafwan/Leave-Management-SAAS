                        Requirement Analysis

1. What Client wants(in brief)??
    A SAAS App that tracks all the attendance of all the employees in a company.
    Firstly when any employer joins then an account will be registered againts him/her.
    then some leave will be registered against that account and employee can leave based
    on that. If he/she takes all the leaves and takes a leave again then some complaints
    will be given and a file will be reported by HR.

Use Cases


3. Problem/Update,
   - If employee takes more than 100% leave 
   - If HR doesn't respond to their leaves,
   - If in a company when many employee of a same project takes leaves then project
     problem will occur or project will get delayed.
